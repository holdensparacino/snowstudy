SnowStudy.org is a collection of resources for private contractors and research conducted on road salt impacts and best management practices. 

The site is maintained and designed by [Holden Sparacino](https://holdensparacino.com) as part of a thesis project researching the practices that winter maintenance and snow removal private contractors adopt, the areas serviced and materials and equipment involved, and how snow removal companies learn best management practices. Ultimately, a long-term outcome of this work is to form recommendations and resources for private contractors aiming to reduce their environmental impacts on surface waters.

This research and thesis is funded by the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](http://noaa.gov/), [Lake Champlain Sea Grant](https://www.uvm.edu/seagrant), [UVM Extension](https://www.uvm.edu/extension), [The University of Vermont Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources](https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr), the [North American Lake Management Society (NALMS)](https://www.nalms.org/), and the [Rubenstein Graduate Student Association](https://www.uvm.edu/rsenr/rubenstein_graduate_student_association_rgsa).
